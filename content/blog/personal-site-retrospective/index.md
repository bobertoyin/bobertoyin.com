All personal sites before the age of 18 are subject to aging like milk. *Unfortunately, so are some of the ones that come after the age of 18.*

As a sort of coronation for this version of my personal site, I figured it'd be fun to look back at previous iterations of my personal site. However, these "previous iterations" aren't the pre-`v2.0.0` verions of this site, but rather sites that looked radically different, contained drastically different content, and were hosted on different platforms with different URLs. Let the viewing and cringing commence!

## Innocence in the BCE (Before College Era)

My first attempts at a personal website came during Fall 2017, having taken both a web development and database class in high school. I actually remember creating the very first version of the site with the [Wix](https://www.wix.com), but ended up porting it to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to flex my new skills and allow for more flexibility. I was able to recover most of the site, but it wasn't from Wix, nor was it from any of my own code repositories (I have a bad habit of wiping old projects instead of preserving them). Instead, I was lucky enough to have found it on my friend's GitHub profile. I'm not sure why he saved my website to his profile, but I've now forked it to my own profile and have it under a [public archive](https://github.com/bobertoyin/old-porftolio-site) so that everyone can view it.

But once I opened it, I kind of wished it had stayed deleted for all eternity.

### The Bad

I know that critiques typically start with what the body of work does well, but I would honestly feel better getting what didn't work out of the way before talking about what did work. 

To start, some of the visual design decisions are poorly executed and one-dimensional, regardless if they were intentional or not. Raleway, the font the site uses for all of the text, is noted as a good display font but [isn't as good for text](https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/2x9vme/comment/coyhhlc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The footer text is lazily placed in the bottom-right of the footer with no spacing around it, and says nothing more than "Designed By Robert Yin."

{{ image(alt='An Underwhelming Footer', img='footer.png', caption='What an underwhelming footer.') }}

There were also some design choices that didn't seem to have any reasonable justification: why are some of the body headers unselectable by the cursor, and why is the rest of the text purple on no background color when selected? Was I intentionally prioritizing mediocre aesthetics over accessibility? Any why did I choose the color purple when it clearly doesn't mesh with the background image and is only ever reinforced by the logo in the header?

Lastly, some of the content on this site clearly has my tenth-grade name on it because it comes off as incredibly unhelpful and awkward to read. The synopsis, for example, was an extreme exaggeration of my relationship with food at the time and just wasn't appropriate to put on the Home page:

> For 16 years, Robert Yin has existed as nothing more than a human who loves to eat. After realizing that his metabolism was no match for his desire to consume sustenance, he put down his fork and knife and picked up computer programming.

And as much as I love my siblings, this quote probably shouldn't have been on the About page:

> He is a chorky lumpkinella.
>
> Rebecca Yin, Robert's Youngest Sister

Even the professional information came off weird: did I really need to format my JavaScript knowledge as "JavaScript (Rudimentary)" or to try and flex my "all expense paid trip to Silicon Valley?"

There's so much more bad meat for me to sink my teeth into on this site, but I'm willing to call it a day for this portion of the critique and blame it all on "inexperience," even if it doesn't actually apply (I'm looking at you, navigation menu and image lightbox scripts that were blatanly copied from StackOverflow, W3Schools, or some other resource for novice web developers).
