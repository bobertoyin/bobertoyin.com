{% about(looking=false) %}
:wave::cowboy_hat_face: Howdy! I'm Robert Yin, a software engineer who dabbles in making important things and specializes in making silly things.

## (In)Frequently Asked Questions :thought_balloon:

> Does anyone actually call you Boberto?

Nope. Bobert and Roberto are historical nicknames that a few people have used, but Boberto was more a product of internet username neccessity than anything else.

> Favorite programming language?

I'm not currently keen on crowning a language as my *favorite*, as my ~~traumatic~~ university curriculum has taught me that every langauge has its pros and cons in various engineering scenarios. However, I find that Python and Rust are my current go-to languages due to their familiarity and ability to do most things well enough. I also enjoy emojis as a *general-purpose* communication medium, but have yet to master it in [code form](https://www.emojicode.org).

> Any hobbies outside of programming/software?

Ever the serial hobbyist, I dabble in home cooking, skateboarding, and photography (film as of late, but some digital as well).
