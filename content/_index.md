:wave::cowboy_hat_face: Howdy! I'm Robert Yin, a fourth-year computer science student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu) (finishing May 2023) and incoming software developer at [Epic](https://www.epic.com) (starting August 2023). My coursework is mostly focused on artificial intelligence, but I'm always interested in learning more about the wider scope of software development, including the tools and design principles that make code work.

## (Not So) Frequently Asked Questions :thought_balloon:

> Does anyone actually call you Boberto? :speaking_head:

Nope. Bobert and Roberto are historical nicknames that a few people have used, but Boberto was more a product of internet username neccessity than anything else.

> Favorite programming language? :nerd_face:

I'm not currently keen on crowning a language as my *favorite*, as my ~~traumatic~~ university curriculum has taught me that every langauge has its pros and cons in various engineering scenarios. However, I find that Python and Rust are my current go-to languages due to their familiarity and ability to do most things well enough. I also enjoy emojis as a *general-purpose* communication medium, but have yet to master it in [code form](https://www.emojicode.org).

> Any hobbies outside of programming/software? :technologist:

Ever the serial hobbyist, I dabble in home cooking, skateboarding, and photography (film as of late, but some digital as well).
