:wave::cowboy_hat_face: Howdy! This site is home to the ~~well-formed thoughts~~ smooth-brained musings of Robert Yin, a fresh-faced software engineer. Good luck trying to make sense of what is posted here, but know that you're always welcome to learn more about me via cursed blog posts and oddball projects!

# Quick Q&A

> What're you up to now? :thinking:

Gearing up to graduate from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu) in Spring 2023.

> Does anyone actually call you Boberto? :speaking_head:

Nope. Bobert and Roberto are historical nicknames that a few people have used, but Boberto was more a product of internet username neccessity than anything else.

> Any hobbies outside of programming? :technologist:

Ever the serial hobbyist, I dabble in home cooking, skateboarding, and photography (film as of late, but some digital as well).
