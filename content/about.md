# About Me

I'm Robert Yin, currently a fourth-year computer science student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu) (finishing May 2023) and an incoming software developer at [Epic](https://www.epic.com) (starting August 2023). My coursework mostly focused on artificial intelligence, but I'm always interested in learning more about the wider scope of software development â€” including some of the tooling and design principles that engineers use to make things work.

# (Not So) Frequently Asked Questions

> Does anyone actually call you Boberto? :speaking_head:

Nope. Bobert and Roberto are historical nicknames that a few people have used, but Boberto was more a product of internet username neccessity than anything else.

> Favorite programming language? :nerd_face:

I'm not currently keen on crowning a language as my *favorite*, as the ~~traumatic~~ curriculum from my university has taught me that every langauge has its pros and cons in various engineering scenarios. However, I find that Python and Rust are my current go-to languages, as they do a lot of things fairly well. I also enjoy emojis as a *general-purpose* communication medium, but have yet to master it in [code form](https://www.emojicode.org).

> Any hobbies outside of programming/software? :technologist:

Ever the serial hobbyist, I dabble in home cooking, skateboarding, and photography (film as of late, but some digital as well).
